            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>
                I describe myself being a Front-End Developer and real estate enthusiast. Both of these aspects are
                fully integrated into my life and, although achieved with a couple of detours, reflect the career path I
                have always dreamed of.
            </p>
            <p>
                Started as an Internal Auditor I was able to make use of my idea of efficient and pragmatic processes
                ever since. As a developer I now have the necessary background to apply my knowledge of business
                processes to combine it with state-of-the-art technology to contribute to the digital transformation in
                Germany.
